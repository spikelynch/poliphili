# Colonnades

_Colonnades_ was inspired by _Hypnerotomachia Poliphili_, a weird and
captivating early modern text by Francesco Colonna which takes the form of a prolonged fantasy about
antique architecture, in which a variety of symbolic and erotic masques and
rituals take place. The text is generated using a Haskell library I put together
a few years ago. I had intended to make a more complicated parody of the 
original's style, doing not just architecture but gardens, tombstone engravings
and nymph's costumes, but I was running out of time, and on a whim I put one of
the very basic sentences into StableDiffusion and was so impressed with the
output (the nonplussed jade emperor on page 6) that I left the text generator
as it was and just cranked out as many images as my laptop could generate in
the remaining time. The results aren't much like the illustrations in the
original, as I didn't give the prompts any stylistic instructions to try to get
Renaissance engravings out of it, but I like the effect of the finished
products anyway.
